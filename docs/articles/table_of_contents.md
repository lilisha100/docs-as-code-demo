# Table-Of-Content (TOC) Files

docfx supports processing Markdown files or Conceptual Files, as well as structured data model in YAML or JSON format or Metadata Files. Besides that, docfx introduces a way to organize these files using Table-Of-Content Files or TOC Files, so that users can navigate through Metadata Files and Conceptual Files.

**Note:** TOC Files must have file name toc.md or toc.yml, but the file name is case-insensitive.
